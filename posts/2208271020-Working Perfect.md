# Backend server works perfectly<br>

As I couldn't use 'Keep Alive' in replit due to the expiration of REPLIT PRO in github student dev pack,
I had to find an server with domain - in fact I rarely know about running a server LOL.
And I finally found Goorm IDE, which works perfectly now :)

I don't know what to say but bye :)
