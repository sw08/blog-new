# Can Money buy happiness? 
Buying happiness with money.
We’re often told it’s not possible and people tend to agree with the idea.
I used to think so, but not anymore. Let me explain why.
A Harvard professor, Michael Norton did some experiements and got interesting results.
In a Vancouver university, he separated the people into two groups, and gave them some money.
He told one group to spend the money for themselves and the other group to spend the money for others.
After they spent the money, he asked both of them how happy they were.
Can you guess the result?
Surprisingly, the group who spent the money on others appeared to be much happier than those who bought something for themselves.
The same result also appeared in Uganda, though the amount of money was different.
Other tests resulted the same as well.
These experiments mean two things.
First, doing good for others is happier than doing good for ourselves in most situations.
Second, the amount of money does not matter.
In conclusion, we can buy happiness with money.
And if you think you can’t buy happiness with money, it might mean you are not spending it right.
So, spend your money in the wise way and buy happiness for not only yourself but also others.
Thank you.
