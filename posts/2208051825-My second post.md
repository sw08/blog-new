# Second Post<br>
I've been working for this for an week. So there may be a bug. But despite of this, I'm so proud of me now. I thought I could never make my own website, but tada! I made it!<br>
This made me think differently from what I have thought. I've been so pessimistic, critical, or negative or etc, but this time, I think I've gotten a little bit more optimistic :)<br>
Now I'm new in running a blog in this way, and yeah. I don't know what to say LOL<br>
Maybe I'd better eat dinner..?<br>
Bye(I have no idea how to end...)<br>
### I'm not serious. I'm just writing any sentenses which came to my mind ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
